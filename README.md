# Nutscript Plugins
Publicly available plugins. Ranging from mundane to unique.
Most if not all are made for Nutscript 1.1-beta, so if you are using another version of NS (namely the non-beta 1.1), you may experience errors.

# Crafting
This is a slightly editted version of Chancer's crafting plugin from respite, found here: https://github.com/Chancerawr/respite/tree/master/respite/plugins/crafting
This is posted here for everyone who needs a working crafting plugin but if unable or unwilling to spend 10 minutes to fix it themselves.

# GMTeleportPoints
This plugin allows admins/gms to set up teleport points across the map. Allowing for quick teleportation and navigation.
For convenience, use /gmtpmenu.

This plugin was made by Sample Name (Sample Name#2010). It fixes the chatbox colour setting, which is currently broken in default NS (both 1.1 and 1.1-beta). If you want to customize the chat color, use this plugin to avoid errors
