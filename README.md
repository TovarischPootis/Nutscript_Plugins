# Nutscript Plugins
Publicly available plugins. Ranging from mundane to unique.
Most if not all are made for Nutscript 1.1-beta, so if you are using another version of NS (namely the non-beta 1.1), you may experience errors.

# Crafting
This is a slightly editted version of Chancer's crafting plugin from respite, found here: https://github.com/Chancerawr/respite/tree/master/respite/plugins/crafting
This is posted here for everyone who needs a working crafting plugin but is unable or unwilling to spend 10 minutes to fix it themselves.

# GMTeleportPoints
This plugin allows admins/gms to set up teleport points across the map. Allowing for quick teleportation and navigation.
For convenience, use /gmtpmenu.

# chatColorFix
!!!NUTSCRIPT 1.1-beta HAS FIXED THIS ISSUE ALREADY. YOU DO NOT NEED THIS IF YOU ARE USING THE LATEST VERSION OF 1.1-beta!!!
This plugin was made by Sample Name (Sample Name#2010). It fixes the chatbox colour setting, which is currently broken in default NS (both 1.1 and 1.1-beta). If you want to customize the chat color, use this plugin to avoid errors

# Crosshair
This is basically the default plugin, but now has a config option to disable it without the need of deleting/disabling the plugin completely
